Code smells

1. Comments
    1.1. Inappropriate Information - Meta-data in source code system/issue tracking system/record-keeping system, and comments should only for technical notes( the code and design )
    1.2. Obsolete Comment - Update as quickly as possible
    1.3. Redundant Comment - Comment should say things that the code cannot say for itself
        i++; //increment i
        Javadoc just tells the function signature
    1.4. Poorly Written Comment
    1.5. Commended-Out Code - Commented-out code is an abomination
        When you see commented-out code, please DELETE it!!

2. Environment
    2.1. Build requires more than one step - Should only have one step
    2.2. Tests require more than one step - Run all the unit tests with just one command - Maven test

3. Functions
    3.1. Too many functions
    3.2. Output arguments
    3.3. Flag Arguments - Function do more than one thing, it should be eliminated
    3.4. Dead Function - Methods that are never called should be discarded

4. General
    4.1. Multiple Languages in One Source file
    4.2. Obvious behavior is unimplemented
    4.3. Incorrect behavior at the boundaries - Every boundary condition, corner case, quirk and exception should be well tested
    ......More to come
