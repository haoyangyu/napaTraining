How to define the better boundary for the codes

1. More encapsulation -  Map<Sensor> provides more capability than we need and want  - If the interface to Map ever change, we need to change all the interfaces that leverage the Map interface
2. Write the test for the third-party code we use, third-party API â€“ Tests, make it as the learning tests
3. Third-party packages/APIs, need to checked in our Learning tests to make sure the code will stay compatible with our needs
4. Adapter design pattern to convert from our perfect interface to the provided interface

How to understand the Adapter Design Pattern
